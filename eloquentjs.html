        <h1>1. Values, Types, and Operators</h1>
        <p>Computers only understand data. Bits are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zeros and ones. Data is stored in sequences of bits.</p>
        <h3>Values</h3>
        <p>In a JavaScript environment, we seperate bits into digestible chunks called values. Values can be comprised of different types, such as the ones listed at the end of this section. To create a value, you simply invoke its name.</p>
        <h3>Numbers</h3>
        <p>Values of the number type are numeric values. JavaScript uses a fixed number of 64 bits to store a single number value. 64 bits limits the amount of different numbers that can be represented. With N decimal digits, you can represent 10N numbers. Given 64 binary digits, you can represent 264 different numbers. 64-bit chunks shouldn't be a problem for the most part since most devices nowadays have a lot of memory, thus not much concern for <i>overflow</i>. You can use fractional numbers with a decimal point and for very big or small numbers you can use scientific notation. Calculations with whole numbers (also called <i>integers</i>) that are smaller than 9 quadrillion are guaranteed to always be precise. Fractional numbers are generally imprecise, thus should be treated as approximations.</p>
        <h3>Arithmetic</h3>
        <p>Numbers are generally used with arithmetic operations. The + and * symbols are called operators. The % symbol is used to represent the remainder operation. X % Y is the remainder of dividing X by Y. For example, 314 % 100 produces 14, and 144 % 12 gives 0.</p>
        <p>Here's a little two-number calculator that I created for basic arithmetic..</p>
        <button onclick="calcNums()">Execute</button>
        <input type="number" placeholder="Num1" name="num1" id="calc-num1">
        <select name="operator" id="calc-operator">
            <option label="+" value="+"></option>
            <option label="-" value="-"></option>
            <option label="*" value="*"></option>
            <option label="/" value="/"></option>
            <option label="%" value="%"></option>
        </select>
        <input type="number" placeholder="Num2" name="num2" id="calc-num2">
        <span>= </span><output id="calc-output"></output>
        <h3>Special Numbers</h3>
        <p>There are three special values in JavaScript that are considered numbers but don’t behave like normal numbers. The first two are <i>Infinity</i> and <i>-Infinity</i>, which represent the positive and negative infinities. The third is <i>NaN</i>, which stands for “not a number”, even though it is a value of the number type.</p>
        <h3>Strings</h3>
        <p>Strings are used to represent text. You can put almost anything between quotes to have JavaScript make a string value out of it. <i>Newlines</i> (the characters you get when you press enter) can be included only when the string is quoted with backticks (`). A backslash (\) inside quoted text indicates that the character after it has a special meaning. This is called <i>escaping</i> the character. \n represents a newline, \t represents a tab. If two backslashes follow each other, they will collapse together, and only one will be left in the resulting string value. Using the + operator on strings results in <i>concatenation</i>.</p>
        <button onclick="alert(`I ain't made this yet bruh..`)">Execute</button>
        <input type="text" placeholder="String1" name="string1" id="string1">
        <span>+</span>
        <input type="text" placeholder="String2" name="string2" id="string2">
        <span>= </span><output id="calc-output"></output>
        <p class="disclaimer">Some of the data types listed below aren't mentioned in this section but I was already aware of their existence so I'm keeping them all here for convenience..</p>
        <h3>Primitive Value Types</h3>
        &bull; <b>Number</b>: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
        </br>&bull; <b>BigInt</b>: Represents integers of arbitrary length, useful for numbers exceeding the standard number type's limits.
        </br>&bull; <b>String</b>: Represents textual data as a sequence of characters enclosed in single or double quotes.
        </br>&bull; <b>Boolean</b>: Represents logical values, either true or false.
        </br>&bull; <b>Null</b>: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
        </br>&bull; <b>Undefined</b>: Represents the value of a variable that has not been assigned a value.
        </br>&bull; <b>Symbol</b>: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as object property keys.
        </p>
        <h3>Non-Primitive Value Types</h3>
        &bull; <b>Object</b>: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, used for more complex data structures, including arrays and functions.
