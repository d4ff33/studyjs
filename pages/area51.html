          This game initially started as me messing around by making a script
          that randomizes some CSS properties of a div. That sparked inspiration
          and motivated me to actually make something out of it. I started off
          with a basic script that randomized the background color, width, top,
          and left positions of a button with an alien emoji inside of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first issue I encountered when I was making this game was trying
          to add an animation to the alien. I tried creating a class with the
          animation which I would then add and remove when clicked. After
          consulting my mentor, the Artist and Game Developer üèÜ 3 Times Awarded
          best gamer (2018-2027)
          <a class="content-link" href="https://x.com/BonbliStar"
            >Bonbli Glormpussy Star</a
          >, I was advised that the script was removing and adding the class so
          fast it traveled back in time thus wasn't appearing in the present.
          Don't ask me how it works, it's an advanced level topic and I'm just a
          baby. This was when Bonbli introduced me to the
          <a
            class="content-link"
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout"
            >setTimeout()</a
          >
          method.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using this method at 1ms worked for the most part. The alien animation
          was a little jank but I was satisfied üòÖ... That's when Bonbli turned
          to me... looked me dead in the eyes and said... "Stop jankin it". üò±
          Bonbli slowly reached into his pocket and pulled out a card. The card
          read as follows...

          method I was able to achieve gorgeous 4K crisp fluid ‚àûfps animations,
          all whilst completely eliminating the need to use classes to trigger
          animations. I was content and on my merry way when I suddenly tripped
          and face planted. I got back up and brushed myself off and that's when
          I saw it for the first time. My childlike wonder blinded me from what
          was right in front of my eyes. The little script I was working on
          turned out to be a viscious spaghetti monster and it was rooting
          itself all around me.. entangling me. That's when I remembered what my
          sensei told me...
          <i
            >"If you ever want me to review your code or are stuck with too much
            spaghetti ill be glad to help."</i
          >
          I was warned this would happen but I was too naive!
        </p>
        <p>
          I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and locked back in. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I got rid
          of all the uneccessary gunk and repetitve code. Now it was time to
          implement the actual game logic. I encountered a few bits here and
          there where assistance was needed, like when I accidentally spawned an
          endless void with a programming spell.

          This threw me for a loop.. pun intended! It turns out, computers
          aren't as smart and awesome as me. I turned to Bonbli and before I
          could even utter a word, he said "<a
            class="content-link"
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setInterval

            >setInterval()</a
          >." <b>NEW ABILITY UNLOCKED!</b>‚è´ Using this nifty little method, I
          was able to patch up that pesky blackhole.. or so I thought. My
          implementation of this method was flawed and all I did was create a
          less powerful black hole, one that kept ticking and ticking till the
          end of time.. I didn't even know it wasn't correctly stopping until I
          used Bonbli's Super Secret Forbidden Jutsu:
          <i>console.log("penis")</i>! Placing that little fella right at the
          beginning of the function allowed me to see how many times it was
          executing, and the solution was simple.
        </p>
        <pre><code style="background-color: rgb(235, 235, 235)">let countdown = 5;
          const startCountdown = () => {
            let timer = setInterval(() => {
              console.log("penis", countdown)
              if (countdown > 0) {
                countdown--;
              } else {
                clearInterval(timer); // this is the important part, here you need to pass the thing that setInterval gives you
              } 
            }, 1000);
          };
          
          startCountdown();</code></pre>
        <p>
          Things were really smooth sailing from this point on. My game was
          playable, just a little ugly. I pushed my game to the branch and let
          my buddies playtest. There was a little exploit that allowed them to
          hold enter and get really highscores. Bonbli-sensei, as always, had
          the answer.
        </p>
        <pre><code style="background-color: rgb(235, 235, 235)"> alien.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
          if (event.key === 'Enter') {
              event.preventDefault();
          }
      });</code></pre>
        <p>
          Phew, that was easy. I tweaked the CSS a bit more and now my game was
          looking pretty good!.. I looked at Bonbli's face and he smiled.. but
          it seemed mostly out of pity.. he told me "You should check this out..
          "

          I had longed for this kind of knowledge and just after reading the
          first few sections, it all clicked in my mind.. This was his subtle
          way of telling me my shit is ass! I needed to restructure my folders
          and fix my naming conventions! I jumped back into my code with
          exuberance and I was immediately struck with confusion.. Did I really
          write all this garbage?? All my bindings were named in inconsistent
          manners. My booleans didn't even have "is" in their name! Suddenly, I
          had a eureka moment, I could just put the entire game into an object!
          Sometimes I scare myself with my own brilliance. heh. üòè
        </p>
        <p>
          After an hour and a half of grueling soul crushing pain and confusion,
          I had successfully refactored my hideous beast into a beauty.. at
          least in my opinion, beauty is subjective afterall. The final tip I
          received from Bonbli was this sacred art called "encapsulation". He
          clarified it wasn't necessary for my tiny little baby game, but it
          would come in handy in the future. I finished it all off by
          encapsulating the randomizing script into the alien object. If you're
          not me and you've made it this far, hope you enjoyed my 100% true
          recounting of events. If you're Bonbli, yo waddup. :3
